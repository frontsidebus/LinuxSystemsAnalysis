# LinuxSystemsAnalysis
aka: "why does my linux server run like flaming cat crap?"

Anything overtly dangerous I tried to comment as such. The majority of things here are read-only commands used for performance analysis specific to Linux boxes. 

This could be useful if you are like me (a sysadmin who pretends to do systems analysis :)) 

Have fun!
