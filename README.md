# LinuxSystemsAnalysis

***Anything overtly dangerous I tried to comment as such. The majority of things here are read-only commands used for performance analysis specific to Linux boxes. ***

This could be useful if you are like me and do mediocre (at best!) systems analysis.

Point of this proj, is more an exercise for me as to why I run the tools the way I do. I wanted to create some scripts out of some of the shadier 1-liners I have, and over-document them so I actually can understand A - COMPLETELY what they do, and B - can articulate such. 

Eventually I'd like this to grow into a set of red-button scripts that can be run on servers with active performance issues, and catch ~80% of the repeated problems seen (ie: file-handle bottlenecks, full filesystems, i/o latency, memory starvation, etc...)

Have fun!
